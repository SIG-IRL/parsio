# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, the maintainers and contributors of **Parsio**, a project under the **SIG-IRL (Special Interest Group for Iranian Languages)** affiliated with the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), are committed to building a diverse, inclusive, and harassment-free community. Our goal is to advance Persian NLP and Iranian language technology through collaboration, and we believe this starts with creating a space where everyone—regardless of age, race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, religion, education, socioeconomic status, or technical expertise—can participate fully and feel respected.

In this spirit, we pledge to:
- Prioritize openness, empathy, and mutual support in all interactions.
- Welcome contributions from individuals of all backgrounds and skill levels.
- Ensure that our community is a safe and positive environment for everyone.

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces related to Parsio, including the GitHub repository, issue trackers, Discussions, documentation, events (online or in-person), and any future communication channels (e.g., Slack, Discord, email).

## Our Standards
We expect all participants in the Parsio community to uphold these standards:

### Positive Behaviors
- **Inclusivity**: Use welcoming and respectful language that embraces diverse perspectives.
- **Collaboration**: Offer and accept constructive feedback graciously, fostering teamwork.
- **Empathy**: Be considerate of others’ experiences, time zones, and skill levels.
- **Clarity**: Communicate with patience, especially when explaining technical or linguistic concepts.
- **Gratitude**: Acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of fellow contributors.

### Unacceptable Behaviors
- **Harassment**: No form of harassment, including offensive comments related to personal characteristics (e.g., gender, race, religion), sexualized language or imagery, or deliberate intimidation.
- **Disrespect**: Avoid trolling, insults, personal attacks, or dismissive attitudes.
- **Discrimination**: Do not exclude or belittle others based on identity, experience, or background.
- **Disruption**: Refrain from spamming, derailing discussions, or posting inappropriate content.
- **Privacy Violations**: Respect confidentiality—do not share private information without consent.
- **Unethical Conduct**: Avoid plagiarism, misrepresentation, or any behavior that undermines the integrity of the project.

These standards apply to all contributions (e.g., code, issues, comments, documentation) and interactions within Parsio-related spaces.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct governs behavior in:
- The Parsio GitHub repository ([github.com/sig-irl/parsio](https://github.com/sig-irl/parsio)).
- Associated communication platforms (e.g., GitHub Discussions, future Slack/Discord).
- SIG-IRL events, such as workshops, hackathons, or presentations.
- Any off-platform interactions (e.g., emails, social media) tied to Parsio or SIG-IRL activities.

It applies to all participants, including maintainers, contributors, users, and SIG-IRL members, whether acting as individuals or representatives of organizations.

## Enforcement
We take violations seriously and will respond promptly to maintain a healthy community.

### Reporting Violations
If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:
1. **Contact Us**: Email the SIG-IRL maintainers at [amirhosseinghanipour@fgn.ui.ac.ir](mailto:amirhosseinghanipour@fgn.ui.ac.ir).
   - Include a description of the incident, when/where it occurred, and any relevant evidence (e.g., screenshots, links).
   - You may report anonymously if preferred.
2. **GitHub Issues**: For public incidents, use the issue tracker with the label `code-of-conduct` (mark as private if sensitive).
3. **Event Reports**: At SIG-IRL events, report to organizers immediately.

All reports will be handled confidentially, with sensitivity to the reporter’s safety and comfort.

### Review Process
- **Initial Review**: Maintainers will assess the report within 48 hours to confirm a violation.
- **Investigation**: We’ll gather details (e.g., from involved parties, logs) fairly and impartially.
- **Decision**: A consensus among maintainers will determine the appropriate response.

### Consequences
Depending on the severity and context, actions may include:
- **Warning**: A private notice to correct behavior, with guidance on expectations.
- **Temporary Ban**: Suspension from participation (e.g., GitHub access, event attendance) for a set period.
- **Permanent Ban**: Removal from all Parsio and SIG-IRL spaces for repeated or severe violations.
- **Content Removal**: Deletion of offending comments, code, or contributions.

Examples:
- A single offensive comment might warrant a warning.
- Repeated harassment or a severe incident (e.g., threats) could lead to a ban.

Maintainers reserve the right to act in the community’s best interest, even if a specific rule isn’t breached, to prevent harm.

### Appeals
If you believe a consequence was unfair:
- Email [amirhosseinghanipour@fgn.ui.ac.ir](mailto:amirhosseinghanipour@fgn.ui.ac.ir) within 7 days, explaining your case.
- A separate maintainer (not involved in the original decision) will review and respond within 14 days.
